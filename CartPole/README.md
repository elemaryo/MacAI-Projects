*fig. 1* A visualization of the problem: moving a cart left and right to balance it

This problem is intended for a society member who is interested in learning more about reinforcement learning, and is comfortable with the MNIST problem / implementing deep learning models.


## What is CartPole?

CartPole is a traditional problem in control theory. It is a simple game, where by moving a cart left or right, a pole is balanced atop the cart as long as possible.
This problem has also become an interesting problem for **Reinforcement Learning**.

**Reinforcement Learning** = A kind of machine learning where an agent learns how in optimally interact within an environment, without any outside knowledge of it.

How does it accomplish this?

There are several methods:

- Policy Gradient learning

- Q-Learning

- Deep Q-Learning

I will provide resources on learning these sort of models. 

In my github, I have projects that implement these types of learning if you are looking for inspiration there!

## Challenge Details

To support our more advanced or adventurous members, we are running an open competition to see who can produce the model that can keep the pole up longest.

Models should be trained using the OpenAI Gym environment "CartPole-v0"

You're encouraged to try out several different model types to see performs best!

## Help

Resources will be posted by Friday Feb 15th, and this document will be updated.

## Dependencies

- Python3

- Tensorflow

- Keras

- Gym

These 4 libraries will be of use to you. Gym and Python are required, and the choice of learning library is up to the participant.
